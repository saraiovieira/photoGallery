## Why?

I did the front-end when I was taking the course [Frontend Masters Web Development](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/) and I customized it in my way.
Later I had the idea to create a server-side for this project where only authenticated users could upload new photos.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://saraiovieira/photoGallery.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd photoGallery
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```
